## The Challenge

The Johnson family bought a beautiful 1920s Victorian home in Oakwood Estates, but soon discovered the low water pressure and rust-colored water were due to original galvanized steel pipes that were completely occluded with mineral buildup.

<Callout type="danger" title="Health Hazard">
Water testing revealed elevated lead levels from the solder joints, posing a serious health risk to the family. Immediate action was required.

## Initial Assessment

Our team conducted a thorough inspection using advanced camera equipment to document the extent of the corrosion throughout the home's plumbing system.

## The Transformation

Preserving the original plaster walls and hardwood floors was the top priority. We chose a PEX repiping solution that allowed us to fish flexible piping through walls with minimal surgical cuts.

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
For historic homes, we always recommend a full camera inspection before creating any access points. This allows us to plan the most efficient route with minimal wall damage.

## Results

Water pressure increased from a trickle to a strong shower, and the water is now crystal clear. The family can finally enjoy their historic home without worrying about water quality.

## Client Testimonial

<Testimonial 
  quote="We were terrified about ruining our historic walls, but FlowMasters respected our home. You can't even tell they were here—except for the amazing water pressure!"

<Callout type="warning" title="Homeowner Advisory">
If you own a home built before 1960, we strongly recommend a water quality test. Many older homes still have lead solder or galvanized pipes that can affect your water quality.
