## Why Maintenance Matters

Your water heater works hard every day, providing hot water for showers, dishes, and laundry. Without regular maintenance, sediment buildup and corrosion can reduce efficiency and shorten its lifespan.

## DIY vs. Professional Service

Some tasks are safe for homeowners, while others require professional expertise:

| Visual inspection | ✅ | |
| Flushing the tank | ✅ | |
| Testing T&P valve | ✅ | |
| Replacing anode rod | | ✅ |
| Thermostat adjustment | | ✅ |
| Gas line inspection | | ✅ |

<Callout type="info" title="Temperature Settings">
For optimal efficiency and safety, your water heater should be set between 120°F and 140°F. Lower temperatures save energy, while higher temperatures reduce bacteria growth.
