## Why This Knowledge is Critical

In a plumbing emergency, every second counts. A burst pipe can release 4-8 gallons of water per minute. Knowing how to quickly shut off your water can mean the difference between a minor cleanup and major water damage.

<Callout type="danger" title="Time is Critical">
Water damage can occur within minutes. Drywall can absorb water in under an hour, and mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours of exposure.

## Locating Your Main Shutoff Valve

The main shutoff valve controls all water entering your home. Common locations include:

  { title: "Basement or Crawl Space", description: "Usually on the wall facing the street, near the water meter.", date: "Location 2" },
  { title: "Garage", description: "Common in warmer climates, often on an exterior wall.", date: "Location 3" },
  { title: "Utility Room", description: "May be near the water heater or other utility connections.", date: "Location 4" }

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Tag your main shutoff valve with a bright-colored label so anyone in your household can find it quickly in an emergency.

## How to Operate Different Valve Types

### Gate Valves (Wheel Handle)
Turn clockwise to close, counterclockwise to open. These older-style valves require multiple turns.

### Ball Valves (Lever Handle)
Quarter-turn operation. When the handle is parallel to the pipe, water flows. Perpendicular means closed.

<Callout type="warning" title="Stuck Valve?">
If your shutoff valve is stuck, don't force it. Applying too much pressure can break the valve or pipe. Call a professional to replace the valve.
</Callout>

## Fixture-Specific Shutoffs

For localized leaks, you may only need to shut off water to a specific fixture:

| Fixture | Typical Shutoff Location |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Toilet | Behind or beside the toilet, near the floor |
| Sink | Under the sink, inside the cabinet |
| Dishwasher | Under the kitchen sink |
| Washing Machine | Behind the machine (hose bibs) |
| Water Heater | Above or beside the unit |
