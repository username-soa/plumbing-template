## Understanding the Risk

When temperatures drop below freezing, the water inside your pipes can freeze and expand, causing pipes to burst. This is especially common in unheated areas like basements, attics, and exterior walls.

A burst pipe can release hundreds of gallons of water per hour, causing thousands of dollars in damage. Prevention is always cheaper than repair.

## What to Do If Pipes Freeze

If you suspect a frozen pipe (reduced water flow, frost visible on pipes), here's what to do:

1. **Keep the faucet open** — Running water helps melt ice
2. **Apply gentle heat** — Use a hair dryer or heating pad, never an open flame
3. **Work from the faucet back** — Start near the faucet and work toward the frozen section
4. **Call a professional** — If you can't locate or thaw the frozen section

<Callout type="warning" title="Never Do This">
Never use a propane torch, blowtorch, or any open flame to thaw pipes. This is a serious fire hazard and can damage your pipes.
